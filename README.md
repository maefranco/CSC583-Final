# CSC583-Final
Create a `sign-in` application that runs on a mobile device, e.g., an iPad or an Android tablet that communicates with a back-end database.  This application is used as a kiosk device to collect information on visitors to a corporation.

## Visitor's View

The `sign-in` application presents to users a web form asking for some necessary information:

- Name
- Email 
- Telephone
- Company
- Official visit (checkbox)
- Escort required (checkbox)
- Escort name (if Escort is checked)

When a visitor hits `submit` the form is sent to the server and stored in a database.  The application is then redirected back to the login screen.

## Admin View

The `sign-in` application offers a password-protected admin view.  This view lists all the data from the database as a table.
